# Documentation

The **engine.py** file contains 'backend' structures: card behavior, turn mechanics and player scoring.

The **interface.py** file contains 'frontend' structures: sprite location, text display and display mechanisms.

The **textbutton.py** file contains the menu components.

The **resources** folder contains all images used as sprites. The card images used were taken from [Kenney's Playing Cards Pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/playing-cards-pack) licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain).

An extensive HTML documentation generated using doxygen from Python function docs can be found in the documentation folder.
